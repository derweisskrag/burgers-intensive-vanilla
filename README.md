# burgers-intensive-vanilla

## Project purpose

To make my first website using vanilla HTML.

During the intensive, the teacher teaches us:

1. HTML
2. CSS (Probably tailwindcss and sass)
3. JS (Events, Nodejs)

Like NEXT, he is going to use some database and this will be, most likely, mongoose because it is easy to use with NODE.js
